                        of all shapes
                        and sizes enjoying themselves .Born between the two world wars, Beryl Cook eventually left
                        Kendrick School in
                        Reading at the age of 15, where she went to secretarial school and then into an insurance
                        office. After moving to
                        London and then Hampton, she eventually married her next door neighbour from Reading, John Cook.
                        He was an
                        officer in the Merchant Navy and after he left the sea in 1956, they bought a pub for a year
                        before John took a
                        job in Southern Rhodesia with a motor company. Beryl bought their young son a box of
                        watercolours, and when
                        showing him how to use it, she decided that she herself quite enjoyed painting. John
                        subsequently bought her a
                        child’s painting set for her birthday and it was with this that she produced her first
                        significant work, a
                        half-length portrait of a dark-skinned lady with a vacant expression and large drooping breasts.
                        It was aptly
                        named ‘Hangover’ by Beryl’s husband and</p>
                    <p>It is often frustrating to attempt to plan meals that are designed for one. Despite this fact, we
                        are seeing
                        more and more recipe books and Internet websites that are dedicated to the act of cooking for
                        one. Divorce and
                        the death of spouses or grown children leaving for college are all reasons that someone
                        accustomed to cooking for
                        more than one would suddenly need to learn how to adjust all the cooking practices utilized
                        before into a
